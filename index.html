    <h2>Our project is an educational website called FORE for Fundamentals Of Robotics
        Education; an interactive learning website designed to teach robotics programming fundamentals
        using ROS to students at a high school to undergraduate level. The goal is to make robotics
        education more accessible by allowing people to learn robotics without needing a robot itself. We
        are assuming that these students have a very basic understanding of programming in general
        before beginning the course. Towards achieving that goal we have made multiple parts of the
        project separately and now are going to work to combine them. We have a flask and MySQL
        database element, a React frontend element, and a ROS simulation and visualization element.</h2>
